## Summary
For a typical 26-base system, the number is from 0-25. But in the excel, it is from 1-26. 

As a result, we have to move the number to the left by 1, in order to use the converting methods in typical n-base systems.

## Clarify
- Are all letters uppercase?

## Solution
### Steps
- init a while loop, and the end condition is n <=0
- inside the loop, we minus 1 from n first
- then take n % 26 as the distance from 'A' to '?'
- take the int part of n / 26 as the new n
### Code
```py
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, n: int) -> str:
        res = []
        while n > 0:
            n -= 1
            digit = n % 26
            n = n // 26
            letter_ascii = ord("A") + digit
            letter = chr(letter_ascii)
            res.append(letter)

        return "".join(reversed(res))
```
