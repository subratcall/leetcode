## Solution 1: Greedy (Optimal)
TC: O(N) SC:O(1)

1. Scan from left to right. Delete the first target digit whose following digit is greater than it.

2. If there's no such a target digit fullfilling the condition, then delete the rightmost target digit.

The painpoint is how to choose the digit when there're over 1 occurance. 

The keypoint is, no matter delete which, the final length are the same. So we just need to make sure when scanning from left to right, every position is at its largest. 

Take `135326` as an example. The 1st postion can only be 1. The 2nd postion can be 5(`15326`) or 3(`13526`). We would delete the 1st 3 as this can make its postion have a larger number.

Vice versa, if there's no such a case, having the following number as a replacement will lead to a loss. We hope to minimize the loss by having it at the rightmost position.

```py
class Solution:
    def removeDigit(self, number: str, digit: str) -> str:
        for i in range(len(number) - 1):
            if number[i] == digit and number[i + 1] > digit:
                return number[:i] + number[i + 1:]
            
        for i in range(len(number) - 1, - 1, -1):
            if number[i] == digit:
                return number[:i] + number[i + 1:] 
```

## Solution 2: Brute Force
TC:O(N^2) SC:O(N)
```py
class Solution(object):
    def removeDigit(self, number, digit):
        """
        :type number: str
        :type digit: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        choices = []
        for i in range(len(number)):
            if number[i] == digit:
                if i == len(number) - 1:
                    rest = number[:i]
                else:
                    rest = number[:i] + number[i+1:]
                choices.append(rest)
        
        res = None
        max_num = -1
        for choice in choices:
            if int(choice) > max_num:
                max_num = int(choice)
                res = choice
                
        return res
```
