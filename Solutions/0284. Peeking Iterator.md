The _Iterator_ class has been defined, and the only difference is the peek().

Here we use a buffer to store the popped out result.

If there is a number in buffer, then it is the one to be returned next. 

```py
class PeekingIterator(object):
    def __init__(self, iterator):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        :type iterator: Iterator
        """
        self._iterator = iterator
        self.buffer = None

    def peek(self):
        """
        Returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator.
        :rtype: int
        """
        if self.buffer:
            return self.buffer
        self.buffer = self._iterator.next()
        return self.buffer

    def next(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        if self.buffer:
            res = self.buffer
            self.buffer = None
            return res
        return self._iterator.next()

    def hasNext(self):
        """
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return (self.buffer is not None) or self._iterator.hasNext()
```
