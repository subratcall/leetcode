## Solution 1
### Steps:
- find all 1s clusters, and all sub-strings in each cluster are still all-1
- the number of sub-strings in each cluster is n*(n+1)/2
### Complexity:
TC: O(n) SC:O(n)
### Code:
```py
class Solution: 
    def numSub(self, s: str) -> int: 
        ones = s.split("0") 
        res = 0 
        for one in ones: 
            n = len(one) 
            res += n * (n + 1) / 2 
        return int(res % (1e9 + 7))
```

## Solution 2
### Steps:
- count the length of sub-string starting from a specific 1
- the length is the number of sub-strings starting from the 1
### Complexity:
TC: O(n) SC:O(1)
### Code:
```py
class Solution: 
    def numSub(self, s: str) -> int:         
        n = len(s) 
         
        j = 1 
        res = 0 
        for i in range(len(s)): 
            if s[i] != "1": 
                continue 
            j = max(j, i + 1) 
            while j < n and s[j] == "1": 
                j += 1 
            res += j - i 
        return int(res % (1e9 + 7))
```
