This challenge is pretty interesting, as it doesn't give the root node. For each node, you can either go up and down. 

Another thing is, as stated in constraints, all node values are unique. Then we can think about just add node value in the set instead of the node, to reduce space consumption.

## Solution 1:

We find the path for each target node, and then compare these two paths to find the LCA.

This idea is also applicable for [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://github.com/yankun-song/leetcode/blob/main/Solutions/0236.%20Lowest%20Common%20Ancestor%20of%20a%20Binary%20Tree.md). 

While for this one, it is much easier to get the path from root to the target node, because you just need to keep going up by visiting its parent.

```py
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        p_path = self.pathfinder(p)
        q_path = self.pathfinder(q)
        p_path_nodes = set(p_path)
        
        for node in q_path:
            if node in p_path_nodes:
                return node
            
    def pathfinder(self, node):
        path = []
        while node:
            path.append(node)
            node = node.parent
        return path
```

Actually we don't have to get the whole `q_path`. We just need to get the whole `p_path`, and then check if the `q` node is in `p_path`.
```py
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        p_path = self.pathfinder(p)
        p_path_nodes = set(p_path)
        while q:
            if q.val in p_path_nodes:
                return q
            q = q.parent
            
    def pathfinder(self, node):
        path = []
        while node:
            path.append(node.val)
            node = node.parent
        return path
```

The solution above can also be refactored. Instead of finding the whole path for `p`, we can move `p` and `q` at the same time, checking if there is a common ancestor.
```py
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        visited = set()
        while True:
            if p:
                if p.val in visited:
                    return p
                visited.add(p.val)
                p = p.parent
            if q:
                if q.val in visited:
                    return q
                visited.add(q.val)
                q = q.parent
```

## Solution 2:
Since we are going up, and there's only one parent, this questin is actually a linked list question. It is the same as [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://github.com/yankun-song/leetcode/blob/main/Solutions/0160.%20Intersection%20of%20Two%20Linked%20Lists.md).

```py
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        p1, q1 = p, q
        while p1 != q1:
            p1 = p1.parent or q
            q1 = q1.parent or p
        return p1
```
