## Solution1
### Steps:
- Calculate the difference needed to fill each bag to full
- Sort the difference array
- Fill from the bag needs minimum rocks, until no available rocks or no available bags
### Complexity:
TC: O(NlogN) SC: O(N)
### Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
        difference = sorted([c - r for c, r in zip(capacity, rocks)])          
        i = 0
        while additionalRocks and i < len(rocks):
            if additionalRocks >= difference[i]:
                additionalRocks -= difference[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        return i
```

## Solution2
The space complexity can be reduced to O(1) if we use the capacity array directly, rather than create a new difference array
### Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
        for i in range(len(rocks)):
            capacity[i] -= rocks[i]
        capacity.sort()
        i = 0
        while additionalRocks and i < len(rocks):
            if additionalRocks >= capacity[i]:
                additionalRocks -= capacity[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        return i
```
