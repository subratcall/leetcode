## Summary:
To check anagrams, we can either use sorting or a frequency hashtable

## Clarify:
- Are all the words in lower case? If not, we need to convert.

## Solution1:
### Keywords
Hashmap, Counter
### Steps
- Iterate through the input array
- For each element, count the occurrence of each letter and store it into a hashmap
- Compare this word's counter with the previous one's
	- If they're identical, then skip this one
	- If not identical, push this word to result
### Complexity
Time O(mn), Space O(m)
### Code
To compare two dictionaries, compare their length first, then compare the value of each key
```py
class Solution:
    def removeAnagrams(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        previous = {}
        current = {}
        for word in words:
            current = collections.Counter(word)
            if len(current) != len(previous):
                res.append(word)
            else:
                for key in previous:
                    if previous[key] != current.get(key, 0):
                        res.append(word)
                        break
            previous = current
        
        return res
```
In python, we can compare to dictionaries directly to check if they're identical. So the code can be simplified as:
```py
class Solution:
    def removeAnagrams(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        previous = {}
        current = {}
        for word in words:
            current = collections.Counter(word)
            if previous != current:
                res.append(word)
            previous = current
        
        return res
```

## Solution2:
### Keywords
Sorting
### Steps
- Iterate through the input array
- For each element, sort the letters so the same letters are grouped together
- Compare this word's counter with the previous one's
	- If they're identical, then skip this one
	- If not identical, push this word to result
### Complexity
Time O(NMlogM), Space O(1)
### Code
```py
class Solution:
    def removeAnagrams(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        previous = ""
        current = ""
        for word in words:
            current = sorted(word)
            if previous != current:
                res.append(word)
            previous = current
        
        return res
```
This solution is a little bit easier to implement. As the length of each word is less than 100, the sorting wouldn't add much time.
