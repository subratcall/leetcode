## Solution 1: Brute Force
The brute force way is pretty straightforward:

1. Find all paths
2. Check each path if it can be a panlindrome

TC:O(N^2)

SC: O(N + k) where k is the number of distinct elements (here is 9)

```py
class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:  
        self.res = 0
        self.dfs(root, [])
        return self.res
        
    def dfs(self, root, visited):
        if not root:
            return
        visited.append(root.val)
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            self.res += self.checkPanlin(visited)
        if root.left:
            self.dfs(root.left, visited)
            visited.pop()
        if root.right:
            self.dfs(root.right, visited)
            visited.pop()
            
    def checkPanlin(self, path):
        counter = collections.Counter(path)
        odd = 0
        for num in counter:
            if counter[num] % 2:
                odd += 1
                if odd > 1:
                    return 0
        return 1
```

As you may have noticed, the time is pretty high. That's because we are doing two separate steps. We spend O(n) time finding all paths, and spend O(n) time iterating through each path, checking if it can be a panlindrome.

As a result, we cannot pass all the test cases, ending up with TLE.

## Solution 2: Use a `set` to track parity on the fly

If we can track parity on the fly, then the time to check panlindrome can be reduced to O(1).

TC: O(N)

SC:O(N + k)

```py
class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:  
        self.res = 0
        self.dfs(root, set())
        return self.res
        
    def dfs(self, root, visited):
        # helpfer function to track parity
        def toggle(val):
            if val in visited:
                visited.remove(val)
            else:
                visited.add(val)
                
        toggle(root.val) 
        
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            if len(visited) <= 1:
                self.res += 1
                return
            
        if root.left:
            self.dfs(root.left, visited)
            toggle(root.left.val)
        if root.right:
            self.dfs(root.right, visited)
            toggle(root.right.val)
```

## Solution 3: Bit Manipulation
With the help of bit manipulation, we can not only track the parity only with an integer, but also check if it can form a panlindrome in O(1) time.

We init the counter with a 9-digit binary number. The i-th (from rightmost) representing number i's occurance's parity.

For each node, we flip the digit at correponding position. To realize this, we use XOR. We do x ^ 1 in that position to flip x. becasue 1 ^ 1 = 0, 0 ^ 1 = 1.

In the end, we need to check panlindrome. In order to form a panlindrome, there should be at most one 1 in the digits.

The trick here is, n & (n - 1) will turn the rightmost 1 into 0. It is deleting a 1 (if there're some) for us. After this, we must have all 0s to form a panlindrome.

TC: O(N)

SC: O(N)
```py
class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: Optional[TreeNode], count = 0) -> int:  
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        count ^= 1 << (root.val - 1)
        
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            if count & (count - 1) == 0:
                return 1
        
        return self.pseudoPalindromicPaths(root.left, count) + self.pseudoPalindromicPaths(root.right, count)
```
