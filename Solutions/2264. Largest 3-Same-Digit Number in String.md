## Clarify:
- The input is a string, and the output is a string.
- The length of input is guaranteed to be no less than 3. No edge cases.

## Solution:
### Steps
1. create a variable max_res to store the result, the initial value is "";
2. iterate through the input, every time we take a slice of length 3 substring;
3. for each substring, compare it with max_res, if substring is larger, then replace;
4. return res
### Complexity
Time O(N), Space O(1)
### Attention
We can compare the string directly, there's no need to convert it to number type.

If we convert it to number type and in the end convert back, do pay attention to 0s. 000 will just be "0".

### Code
```py
class Solution:
    def largestGoodInteger(self, num: str) -> str:
        max_res = ""
        for i in range(len(num) - 2):
            current = num[i: i+3]
            if current[0] == current[1] == current[2]:
                if current > max_res:
                    max_res = current
        return max_res	
```
