## Clarify
- Do we need to really remove the nodes from the tree? Or it's just the way of thinking?

## Solution1
### Steps:
- Use recursion to get the result of left and right
- Combine the results together
### Complexity:
I think the complexity is over O(n), because we keep re-assigning arrays.
### Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def findLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []
        res = []
        leftLeaves = self.findLeaves(root.left)
        rightLeaves = self.findLeaves(root.right)
        i = 0
        while i < min(len(leftLeaves), len(rightLeaves)):
            res.append(leftLeaves[i] + rightLeaves[i])
            i += 1
        if i < len(leftLeaves):
            res += leftLeaves[i:]
        else:
            res += rightLeaves[i:]
        res .append([root.val])
        return res
```

## Solution2
The categorize the nodes based on the depth. By convention, the depth starts from the root, and increases as you go down. Now we define it as the distance from the leaf node.
### Steps:
- create a helper function findDepth 
- calculate the depth for each node, and save the result into the dictionary, whose keys are the depths
- return the values in the dict, no need to sort based on keys, because the low level depth will always be added before higher ones
### Complexity:
Both O(n) for time and space.
### Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def findLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def findDepth(root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            left_depth = findDepth(root.left)
            right_depth = findDepth(root.right)
            root_depth = max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
            heights_record[root_depth].append(root.val)
            return root_depth
            
        heights_record = defaultdict(list)
        findDepth(root)
        return heights_record.values()
```
