## Solution
### Steps:
We only need to resolve collision when the following conditions are all met:
1. stack is not empty
2. top element is going right
3. incoming element is going left
In other cases, we just need to push the element into stack
### Code:
```py
class Solution: 
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]: 
        stack = [] 
        for ast in asteroids: 
            while stack and stack[-1] > 0 and ast < 0: 
                collision = stack[-1] + ast 
                if collision > 0: 
                    break 
                elif collision < 0: 
                    stack.pop() 
                else: 
                    stack.pop() 
                    break 
                     
            else: 
                stack.append(ast) 
         
        return stack
```
Here we're using while-else , the use of it is shown below:
