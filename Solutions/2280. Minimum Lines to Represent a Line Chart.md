## Summary
It's not a good idea to compare fraction results directly. Instead, we compare the cross product or the simplified denominator
- 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3
- The computer uses base-2 floating-point number whereas Human(We) use base-10 floating-point numbers.
- So computers can not accurately represent numbers like 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 at all as it uses binary floating-point format.

## Clarify
- Is the input array sorted? We need to have it sorted.
- Are the numbers in the array all integers? If not, the GCD method may not apply

## Solution1
Compare the slope directly.  Will get wrong answer due to the approximation.

### Code: 
```py
class Solution:
    def minimumLines(self, stockPrices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        stockPrices.sort()
        count = 0
        k = None
        for i in range(1, len(stockPrices)):
            current, prev = stockPrices[i], stockPrices[i-1]
            current_k = (current[1] - prev[1]) / (current[0] - prev[0])
            if current_k != k:
                count += 1
            k = current_k
        return count
```

## Solution2
Instead of storing the slope directly, we store the numerator and denominator separately. Then use cross production to compare two slopes.
### Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def minimumLines(self, stockPrices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        stockPrices.sort()
        count = 0
        k = [float('inf'), 1]
        for i in range(1, len(stockPrices)):
            current, prev = stockPrices[i], stockPrices[i-1]
            current_k = [(current[1] - prev[1]), (current[0] - prev[0])]
            if k[0] * current_k[1] != k[1] * current_k[0]:
                count += 1
            k = current_k
        return count
```

## Solution3
We store the numerator and denominator as the simplified version, by dividing them by GCD. Then when comparing two slopes, A's numerator should be exactly the same as the B's numerator. So are the denominators. This can avoid overflow due to production.
## Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def minimumLines(self, stockPrices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        stockPrices.sort()
        count = 0
        dy, dx = float('inf'), 1
        for i in range(1, len(stockPrices)):
            dy1 = stockPrices[i][1] - stockPrices[i-1][1]
            dx1 = stockPrices[i][0] - stockPrices[i-1][0]
            gcd = math.gcd(dy1, dx1)
            dy1 /= gcd
            dx1 /= gcd
            if dy1 != dy or dx1 != dx:
                count += 1
                dy, dx = dy1, dx1
        return count
```
