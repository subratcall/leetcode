## Summary
To check if the n-th bit of x is set, we can use the following method:
```
if (x & (1<<n)) {
  n-th bit is set
}
else {
  n-th bit is not set
}
```
## Clarify
- The max value of candidate

## Solution
### Steps:
- Determine how many bits are there at most
- Iterate through each bit
	- Count how many numbers can we have, to make the AND result's i-th bit be 1 (all participants' i-th bit should be 1)
- Take the max count as result
### Complexity:
Time O(30N), Space O(1) 
### Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def largestCombination(self, candidates: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        # max number is 1e7 < 1e9 < (1024)^3 = 2^30
        # so at most 30 bits
        for i in range(30):
            count = 0
            for num in candidates:
                if num & (1 << i):
                    count += 1
            res = max(res, count)
        return res
```
