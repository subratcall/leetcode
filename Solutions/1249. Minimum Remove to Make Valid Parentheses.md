It's not hard to realize we can use `stack` to solve it.

An easier version of such challenges is, given a string with only left and right parentheses, how many of them should be removed to make it valid. For this, we just need to use a stack, or even just an integer `count`, to count the left parentheses.

To make the question above harder, we need to return a valid result. It is harder, because we cannot just keep a count. We must have a record of every character we have visited, and even their index, in order to return the whole string. Now we care about the path as well, not only the final result.

The trick to do this is, we first create a list `record` to store all the characters. Then we use a stack to store the index of the left parentheses. If the parentheses need to be removed, then we replace it with an empty string. At last, we convert the `record` list back to a string. 

Back to this question, it looks even harder, as there are some letters involved. However, these letters do not matter at all.


```py
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        record = list(s)
        stack = []
        for i, ch in enumerate(record):
            if ch == "(":
                stack.append(i)
            elif ch == ")":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    record[i] = ''
        while stack:
            record[stack.pop()] = ''

        return ''.join(record)
```
