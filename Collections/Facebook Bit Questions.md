Facebook interviewers like this question and propose it in four main variations. The choice of algorithm should be based on the input format:

1. Strings (the current problem). Use schoolbook digit-by-digit addition. Note, that to fit into constant space is not possible for languages with immutable strings, for example, for Java and Python. Here are two examples:

   - Add Binary: sum two binary strings.

   - [415.Add Strings](https://github.com/yankun-song/leetcode/blob/main/Solutions/415.Add%20Strings.md): sum two non-negative numbers in a string representation without converting them to integers directly.

2. Integers. Usually, the interviewer would ask you to implement a sum without using + and - operators. Use bit manipulation approach. Here is an example:

   - Sum of Two Integers: Sum two integers without using + and - operators.

3. Arrays. The same textbook addition. Here is an example:

   - Add to Array Form of Integer.
   
4. Linked Lists. Sentinel Head + Textbook Addition. Here are some examples:

   - Plus One.

   - Add Two Numbers.

   - Add Two Numbers II.
